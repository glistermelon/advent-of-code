## Notes on inclusion of inputs

Okay; I know it might be controversial, but I'm going to include my inputs regardless of Eric's request not to. Here is my reasoning:

(TLDR: Including my inputs doesn't affect Eric in any way that I believe is actually a problem.)

1. Assuming that puzzle inputs are generated for each person uniquely, I doubt they're copyrighted.

2. Someone trying to create a "copy of AoC" could easily attain puzzle inputs directly from the site itself. Honestly, if I was trying to do it, I would never think first to go scour github repos.

3. I don't care if someone tries to copy AoC. I see two possibilities.
   The first one is that someone is trying to copy it to use it on a small scale, like with their friends or something, in which case I see no issue.
   The problematic case is if someone tries to create a large-scale copy, especially with the intent to make money off of it. However, in that case,
   it should really be a copyright of the problems themselves that is preventative, not the puzzle inputs.

4. Being even broader, I think it's perfectly fine to include any part of AoC in any project with lack of malicious intent. I can think of a lot of theoretical projects built upon AoC that would not affect Eric whatsoever.
   So long as credit is provided, it isn't a problem to me.

   * *Sure, it isn't a problem for you, but this isn't your work at hand, and it IS a problem for the developer.* I operate on my own beliefs, not others'.

Summarily, **please don't ask me to remove the inputs. I won't do it unless legal precedent is introduced.**
